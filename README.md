Machine Learning using Python on Classifying Fruits

I explore the applications of Machine Learning using Python. This program was inspired by the, "Hello World-Machine Learning Recipes #1" video from Google Developers.

In this program, I import the sklearn library, along with the tree in order to enable a decision tree. In the label section of my code, although the tutorial used binary, I used a strings in order for the output to produce a specific name of the object, rather than a binary value.

Ultimately, this tutorial allowed me to gain an applicative experience of machine learning, which I will later conduct as a personal project.
